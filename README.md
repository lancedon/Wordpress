Considerations:

The Job description i received was to work with Wordpress and PHP, due that i use Wordpress to build the sample tool.
The layout i used the theme pure for wordpress and try keep really simple due my focus is backend activities.



For execute this project you will need a server with:
- Mysql
- php 5.6 or newer

The file /wordpress/wp_user.sql is the dump of the mysql database, the user was set with wp_user and the password is 123456.
(if you need you only have change that in wp-config.php)
